        I am a <strong>first-year medical resident in Internal Medicine</strong> at <strong>University of Texas Southwestern</strong>. Previously, I've

        My professsional focus is in the field of <strong> drug develompent </strong>. However, I also like writing & thinking about the history of technology (with specific interests
        in semiconductors, aerospace, machine tools, chemicals, automobiles) and economics (specifically, industrial organization, antitrust, and the economics of innovation).
